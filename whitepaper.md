# Decentralized Light-Client via ZK Proof Aggregation
## A Novel Approach to Cross-Chain State Verification Using Chainlink Oracle Networks

**Chromion Hackathon 2025 Submission**

---

## Abstract

We present a novel proof-aggregating oracle system that enables trustless, gas-efficient cross-chain state verification through zero-knowledge proof aggregation. Our solution addresses the critical challenge of verifying remote blockchain state without relying on centralized relayers or expensive on-chain computation. By leveraging recursive zk-SNARKs and Chainlink's decentralized oracle infrastructure, we compress multiple validity checks into a single succinct proof, dramatically reducing verification costs while maintaining cryptographic security guarantees.

The system integrates Chainlink VRF for unbiased random sampling, Chainlink Functions for decentralized off-chain ZK computation, Chainlink Automation for scheduled proof requests, and Chainlink CCIP for secure cross-chain proof delivery. This architecture represents a paradigm shift from traditional light client implementations, offering a scalable foundation for cross-chain interoperability.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Modern blockchain ecosystems face a fundamental challenge: how to verify the state of one blockchain from another in a trustless, scalable manner. Current solutions fall into two problematic categories:

1. **Centralized Relayers**: Fast but introduce trust assumptions and single points of failure
2. **On-Chain Light Clients**: Trustless but prohibitively expensive due to gas costs for block header verification and state proof validation

This creates a critical gap in blockchain interoperability, limiting the development of sophisticated cross-chain applications such as bridges, multi-chain DeFi protocols, and decentralized exchanges.

### 1.2 Our Solution

We propose a **Decentralized Light-Client via ZK Proof Aggregation** that combines:

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Aggregation**: Multiple state validity proofs are recursively combined into a single succinct proof
- **Decentralized Oracle Computation**: Chainlink's distributed network performs heavy cryptographic operations off-chain
- **Verifiable Randomness**: Chainlink VRF ensures unbiased sampling of blockchain state to audit
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Chainlink CCIP enables secure proof delivery across different blockchains

This approach reduces on-chain verification to a single proof check while maintaining full cryptographic security guarantees.

### 1.3 Key Innovations

1. **Proof Aggregation Architecture**: First implementation of recursive zk-SNARK aggregation for cross-chain state verification
2. **Oracle-Powered ZK Computation**: Novel integration of Chainlink Functions for decentralized zero-knowledge proof generation
3. **Randomized State Sampling**: Use of Chainlink VRF to prevent adversarial manipulation of audit targets
4. **Minimal On-Chain Footprint**: Single proof verification regardless of the number of validated state elements

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Cross-Chain Verification Challenges

Cross-chain state verification has been a persistent challenge in blockchain interoperability. Traditional approaches include:

**Light Clients**: Verify block headers and Merkle proofs on-chain, but require significant gas for each verification operation. Ethereum's light client implementations can cost thousands of gas units per block header verification.

**Optimistic Verification**: Assume validity unless challenged, but introduce delay periods and potential security vulnerabilities during dispute windows.

**Multi-Signature Schemes**: Rely on trusted validator sets, introducing centralization risks and potential collusion vectors.

### 2.2 Zero-Knowledge Proof Aggregation

Proof aggregation, as described in recent cryptographic research¹, enables the compression of multiple SNARK proofs into a single proof with constant verification time. This technique has been successfully applied in:

- **Rollup Scaling**: Aggregating transaction validity proofs
- **Recursive Composition**: Building complex proof systems from simpler components
- **Batch Verification**: Reducing verification costs for multiple proofs

### 2.3 Oracle Networks in Cryptographic Systems

Chainlink's oracle infrastructure provides the necessary decentralization and security properties for cryptographic applications:

- **Chainlink Functions**: Decentralized off-chain computation with consensus mechanisms
- **Chainlink VRF**: Verifiable randomness with on-chain proof verification
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Secure cross-chain messaging with multi-signature validation

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Design

Our system architecture consists of four primary components:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Source Chain  │    │  Chainlink DON   │    │ Target Chain    │
│                 │    │                  │    │                 │

        │                        │                        │

             Sampling                  (if needed)
```

### 3.2 Component Specifications

#### 3.2.1 On-Chain Verifier Contract

The verifier contract serves as the primary interface for proof requests and verification:

```solidity
contract ZKProofAggregator {
    // Core verification function - only operation performed on-chain
    function verifyAggregatedProof(
        bytes calldata proof,
        uint256[] calldata publicInputs
    ) external returns (bool);
    
    // Proof request initiation
    function requestProof(
        uint256 chainId,
        bytes32 stateRoot,
        uint256 blockNumber
    ) external;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Single proof verification regardless of aggregated proof count
- Integration with all Chainlink services
- Gas-optimized verification logic
- Event emission for proof status tracking

#### 3.2.2 Chainlink Functions Integration

Chainlink Functions nodes execute the following workflow:

1. **Data Fetching**: Retrieve block headers, state roots, and Merkle proofs from source chain RPC endpoints
2. **Circuit Execution**: Run Circom-compiled circuits to generate individual validity proofs
3. **Proof Aggregation**: Use Nova or custom PLONK circuits to fold multiple proofs into one
4. **Result Consensus**: DON nodes reach consensus on the final aggregated proof

```javascript
// Chainlink Functions source code structure
const executeZKComputation = async (args) => {
    // Fetch blockchain data
    const blockData = await fetchBlockData(args.chainId, args.blockNumber);
    
    // Generate individual proofs
    const proofs = await generateStateProofs(blockData);
    
    // Aggregate proofs using Nova recursion
    const aggregatedProof = await aggregateProofs(proofs);
    
    return aggregatedProof;
};
```

#### 3.2.3 VRF-Based Random Sampling

Chainlink VRF provides cryptographically secure randomness for selecting audit targets:

```solidity
function requestRandomSample() internal {
    uint256 requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords(
        keyHash,
        subscriptionId,
        requestConfirmations,
        callbackGasLimit,
        numWords
    );
}

function fulfillRandomWords(uint256 requestId, uint256[] memory randomWords) 
    internal override {
    // Use randomness to select blocks/state elements to verify
    uint256 targetBlock = (randomWords[0] % blockRange) + startBlock;
    initiateProofGeneration(targetBlock);
}
```

#### 3.2.4 Cross-Chain Proof Delivery

CCIP enables secure proof transmission across different blockchain networks:

```solidity
function sendProofCrossChain(
    uint64 destinationChainSelector,
    address receiver,
    bytes memory proof
) external {
    Client.EVM2AnyMessage memory message = Client.EVM2AnyMessage({
        receiver: abi.encode(receiver),
        data: proof,
        tokenAmounts: new Client.EVMTokenAmount[](0),
        extraArgs: "",
        feeToken: address(0)
    });
    
    router.ccipSend(destinationChainSelector, message);
}
```

### 3.3 Zero-Knowledge Circuit Design

#### 3.3.1 Base Verification Circuit

Our Merkle proof verification circuit validates state inclusion:

```circom
template MerkleProof(levels) {
    signal input leaf;
    signal input pathElements[levels];
    signal input pathIndices[levels];
    signal output root;
    
    component hashers[levels];
    component mux[levels];
    
    for (var i = 0; i < levels; i++) {
        hashers[i] = Poseidon(2);
        mux[i] = MultiMux1(2);
        
        mux[i].c[0][0] <== pathElements[i];
        mux[i].c[0][1] <== i == 0 ? leaf : hashers[i-1].out;
        mux[i].c[1][0] <== i == 0 ? leaf : hashers[i-1].out;
        mux[i].c[1][1] <== pathElements[i];
        
        mux[i].s <== pathIndices[i];
        hashers[i].inputs[0] <== mux[i].out[0];
        hashers[i].inputs[1] <== mux[i].out[1];
    }
    
    root <== hashers[levels-1].out;
}
```

#### 3.3.2 Proof Aggregation Circuit

The aggregation circuit combines multiple validity proofs:

```circom
template ProofAggregator(n) {
    signal input proofs[n][8]; // Groth16 proofs
    signal input publicInputs[n][m];
    signal output aggregatedProof[8];
    
    // Recursive verification of individual proofs
    component verifiers[n];
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        verifiers[i] = Groth16Verifier();
        verifiers[i].proof <== proofs[i];
        verifiers[i].publicInputs <== publicInputs[i];
    }
    
    // Aggregate verification results
    component aggregator = NovaFold(n);
    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        aggregator.inputs[i] <== verifiers[i].out;
    }
    
    aggregatedProof <== aggregator.out;
}
```
